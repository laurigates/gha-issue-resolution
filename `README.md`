### Issue Resolution Workflow

This workflow utilizes the Gemini AI platform to analyze GitHub issues and provide AI-generated suggestions. It assists in automating issue management tasks, such as issue classification, labeling, and suggested responses. The workflow runs daily, scans newly opened or reopened issues, and generates suggestions based on Gemini's analysis.

### Usage

**Automatic issue analysis:** The workflow runs automatically on a daily schedule, analyzing newly opened or reopened issues.

**Manual triggering:** The workflow can be manually triggered using the "Actions" tab in the repository.

**Custom configuration:** The workflow can be customized by providing specific issue labels or filters in the workflow file.
